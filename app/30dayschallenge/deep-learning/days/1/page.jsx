        <p>
          The Hello World program is a simple program that prints the message
          "Hello, World!" to the screen. It is often used as the first program
          that new programmers write when learning a new programming language.

          Data type and variables in Python programming
        </h2>
        <p>
          In Python, variables are used to store data values. Variables are
          created when you assign a value to them. Variables can store different
          types of data, such as numbers, strings, and lists.

          Conditional statements in Python

        <p>
          Conditional statements are used to make decisions in a program. In
          Python, conditional statements are used to execute a block of code
          only if a certain condition is met. There are three types of
          conditional statements in Python: if, elif, and else.
        </p>

          Loops in Python programming

        <p>
          Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. In Python,
          there are two types of loops: for loops and while loops. For loops are
          used to iterate over a sequence of items, such as a list or a string.
          While loops are used to repeat a block of code as long as a certain
          condition is met.

        <p>
          Functions are used to organize code into reusable blocks. In Python,
          functions are defined using the def keyword. Functions can take
          arguments and return values. Functions are used to break down complex
          problems into smaller, more manageable pieces.

          Classes are used to create new types of objects in Python. Classes
          define the properties and behavior of objects. Objects are instances
          of classes. Objects can have attributes and methods. Classes and
          objects are used to create reusable code and organize code into
          logical units.
